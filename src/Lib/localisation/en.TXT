Welcome to MCEBuddy
Multichannel audio
Check to allow multi-channel audio if the source video supports it.\r\nBy default the audio is limited to 2 channels (stereo).
Dynamic Range Compression (DRC)\r\nWhen the source is an AC3 audio, enabling DRC will\r\nreduce the difference between the loud and the soft\r\nsounds making the audio track more even.\r\nIf you have a multi-channel audio recording and you\r\nfeel the volume is too soft, checking this box might help.

Only detect Ads
Check this if you want MCEBuddy to detect the ads (commercials) but NOT cut them from the video.\r\nWhen this option is enabled, MCEBuddy will create an EDL file along with the converted file that specifies the locations of ads in the converted video.\r\nAlso, for MP4, M4V and MKV files MCEBuddy will create Chapters to mark the end of commercials.

Select this to filter the type of recordings being converted.\r\n\r\nMovies - select this to convert if the show type is Movie.\r\nShows - select this to convert if the show type is NOT a Movie.\r\nSports - select this to convert if the show type is Sports.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Show type is read from the recording metadata.\r\nOnly some recordings support show type metadata such as WTV and\r\nrecordings with supporting metadata files (XML/ARG etc).
This box shows all the files in queue for conversion.\r\nDrag and drop files here or press the Add button to add files to the conversion queue

Insert at top of queue
By default, new conversions are added to the bottom (end) of the conversion queue.\r\nIf this box is checked, any new conversions added by this task will be added to the\r\nbeginning (top) of the conversion queue.
Add subtitles and chapters
Enable this option to add any extracted subtitles and chapters to the converted video.\r\nEach chapter marks the end of a commercial. This only works with supported formats (e.g. MKV, MP4).\r\n\r\nNOTE: Some players and older TV's don't support embedded subtitles and chapters.\r\nIf you're unable to playback the converted video's, try turning this option off.
Select best soundtrack
If the original video has multiple soundtracks, this option tells MCEBuddy to select the most appropriate and primary soundtrack.\r\nIf you want a specific language soundtrack, make sure you enter the language name or code in the Audio Language box.\r\nCheck this box if you're hearing the wrong soundtrack in your converted file.\r\n\r\nUncheck this box if you want MCEBuddy to retain all the soundtracks from the original video in the converted file when possible.\r\nNOTE:Some profiles do not support multiple soundtracks, in which case this setting has no effect.
Enable remote access
This creates an exception in the windows firewall for MCEBuddy application and the port.\r\nThis is required if you have windows firewall enabled and want to use UPnP, the remote client\r\nor access the engine using an IP address.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you have a custom firewall, this may not work, you will need to manually create an\r\nexception for MCEBuddy service and the port.
Unable to communicate with engine. Firewall exception settings have not been updated.
Detect and optimize video quality
When enabled, MCEBuddy will optimize the video processing options by trying to detect the video source type.\r\nThis can improve the quality of the converted video significantly if correctly detected.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It does this by trying to detect the video source type (interlaced, progressive or telecine).\r\nIf it is able to detect the video source type, it will override the corresponding parameters in the profile.\r\nTurn this option off if you are facing issues with converted video quality or want to use the default profile parameters.

Frame rate
Enable this to set a custom framerate (FPS) for the converted video.\r\nYou may need to set this while converting video formats (e.g. PAL to NTSC)\r\nor for devices which support only specific framerates.\r\n\r\nE.g.: 25\r\nE.g.: 30000/1001
Skip remuxing files
CHECK THIS BOX AT YOUR OWN RISK.\r\nDO NOT CHECK THIS BOX UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.\r\nCheck this box to skip remuxing the original file to a TS file while converting.\r\nIf this is checked, some functions like subtitle extraction or comskip may not work.\r\nIt can also even lead to conversion failures or other unforeseen conversion issues.

Monitor converted videos
By default Monitor Locations will ignore files that have already been converted.\r\nCheck this box if you also want to monitor converted files in the Monitor Path.\r\nCAUTION: This can lead to an infinite conversion loop of converted files if not configured properly.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when you are specifying the output directory of a conversion task\r\n(converted file) as the Monitor Path of a Monitor Location and linking the\r\nMonitor Location to another conversion task.

Hardware encoding
Check this box to use hardware encoding when available to convert videos.\r\nThis can speed up the conversion significantly and reduce the CPU utilization\r\nbut it can result in slightly lower quality videos.\r\n\r\nUncheck this box if you're facing conversion or quality issues.
Do not overwrite files
When this box is checked, the destination file will not be overwritten if it already exists.\r\nInstead a new file will be created with a unique number added to the end of the filename.
Re-monitor recorded videos
By default, once a source file (Recorded video) has been converted,\r\nthe monitor history will track the filename and not queue the same files again.\r\n\r\nEnable this option to ignore the history and monitor all files and add them to\r\nthe conversion queue, even if they have already been converted.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful sometimes, if the recording software does not generate a\r\nunique filename for each episode/show. It is reccomended to use the\r\nDelete original file option in the Settings page when using this option to avoid\r\nan infinite conversion loop.
Recommendation
To avoid an infinite conversion loop, it is recommended to setup your Monitor search pattern in a way such as to ensure that the converted files are not being monitored by this Monitor task.
CHECK THIS BOX AT YOUR OWN RISK.\r\nDO NOT CHECK THIS BOX UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.\r\nBy default Monitor Locations will not remonitor recorded videos that have been processed.\r\nCheck this box if you want to remonitor and reconvert the recorded videos.
To avoid an infinite conversion loop, it is recommended that you enable Delete original file option in the Settings page.
Prioritize air date matching
MCEBuddy uses the episode name to match the series information\r\nwhile searching the internet. If that fails then it uses the original broadcast\r\nair date to match the metadata.\r\n\r\nCheck this box to use the original broadcast air date first and then the\r\nepisode name to match for the series information from the internet.\r\nThis can be useful in some cases when multiple seasons have the same\r\nepisode name. E.g. Americal Idol, Audition 1\r\n\r\nNOTE: Original broadcast air date is not always accurate set by the\r\nbroadcaster and sometimes the information on the internet is incorrect.\r\nUse this option only if the default option is not working for you.
Skip eMail body
Check this option to use an empty body in the notification eMail.\r\nThis can be useful if you're using a SMS gateway for eMail notifications.
